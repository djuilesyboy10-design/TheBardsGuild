# Bard Performance Main Topic
# Simplified ESP Dialogue Topic Structure

## Topic: Publican Services
## Condition: Function/class == "Publican" OR Function/class == "Innkeeper"
## NPC Response: "Welcome to my establishment! How can I help you today?"
## Result: [StartScript PublicanDummySpell]

## Notes:
## - Single topic approach - much cleaner!
## - Script adds dummy ability "bard_performance_dummy" to player
## - Lua detects ability and shows Publican menu with 5 service options
## - Lua menu handles all service options (Rumors to Business)
## - Perfect ESP + Lua separation
## - Maximum flexibility for other modders
