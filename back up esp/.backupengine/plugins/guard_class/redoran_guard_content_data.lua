*The Redoran guard stands tall, hand resting on their weapon hilt*

Honor is everything to a Redoran.
It's not just words - it's the steel in our spine,
the fire in our hearts, the duty in our souls.

Honor means protecting the weak,
defending House Redoran's name,
and never backing down from our responsibilities.

It means choosing the hard right over the easy wrong.
It means standing watch while others sleep,
facing the blight while others flee.

Outlanders see our ways as rigid.
They don't understand that without honor,
without duty, without tradition...
we are nothing but dust in the ash winds.

This is the Redoran way.
This is our honor.

*The guard gestures toward the Redoran Council chambers*

My duties? They are the same as every Redoran warrior.

Protect the Council and the people of House Redoran.
Maintain order in our districts.
Keep the blight and its creatures at bay.

We patrol the roads between our settlements,
ensure caravans reach their destinations safely,
and serve as the shield between civilization and chaos.

But our greatest duty?
To uphold Redoran's honor.
To show all of Morrowind that House Redoran
stands strong, proud, and unbroken.

Every morning I don this armor,
every night I stand my watch,
I am serving something greater than myself.

That is the Redoran burden.
And the Redoran privilege.

*The guard's expression becomes carefully neutral*

The other houses... each walks their own path.

House Hlaalu values gold above honor.
They trade with anyone, bend rules for profit,
and call themselves practical. We call them compromised.

House Telvanni hoards knowledge and power.
They hide in their towers, meddling with forces
they barely understand, looking down on all others.

House Dagoth... that is not a house anymore.
That is a blight upon the land, a corruption
that all true Dunmer must oppose.

Each house has its strengths, its weaknesses.
But only Redoran remembers the old ways,
the true ways, the ways of honor and duty.

The other houses have forgotten what matters.
Redoran never will.

*The guard's hand tightens on their weapon*

Vvardenfell faces threats from all directions.

The blight spreads like a cancer through the land,
corrupting creatures, twisting the land itself.
Dagoth Ur's influence grows stronger daily.

But there are other dangers.
The Empire's grip tightens, their laws choking our traditions.
Outlanders flood our shores, bringing their foreign ways.

Even the other houses plot against each other,
weakening all of Dunmer kind against our true enemies.

Redoran stands on the front lines of every battle.
We fight the blight in the ashlands,
we guard our borders from Imperial interference,
we maintain order when chaos threatens to consume all.

Someone must stand watch.
That someone is House Redoran.

*The guard studies you with measured respect*

You seek wisdom from a Redoran guard?
Then listen well, outlander.

First: Learn respect.
Respect our traditions, our customs, our elders.
Respect that this is our land, not yours to claim.

Second: Understand duty.
A Dunmer's duty is to their house, their people, their gods.
Without duty, you are nothing but a wandering ghost.

Third: Face challenges with courage.
The ash storms will break you if you show fear.
The blight will consume you if you show weakness.

Finally: Know your place.
You are a guest in our house.
Act with honor, and you will be treated with honor.
Act without it, and you will learn why Redoran warriors
are feared throughout Vvardenfell.

Choose your path wisely, outlander.
