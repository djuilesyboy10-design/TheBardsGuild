        content = [[
The ancient art of Bard Lore speaks of heroes long past,
Their songs and stories echoing through time.
Each verse a treasure, each melody a key,
To unlock the mysteries of history's grand design.

From tavern halls to castle courts so grand,
The bards weave tales across the land.
Their words carry power, their music brings peace,
A legacy that will never cease.

    [2] = {
        title = "Melodies of Morrowind",
        content = [[
In Morrowind's land where ash falls gray,
The bards sing songs of olden day.
Of heroes brave and dragons old,
Of stories worth more than gold.

From Red Mountain to the sea,
Their melodies float wild and free.
Each note a memory, each chord a tale,
Where magic and reality prevail.

    [3] = {
        title = "Whispers and Rumors",
        content = [[
The whispers in Balmora's streets tell tales,
Of merchants rich and ancient trails.
The Telvanni wizards in their towers high,
Keep secrets that touch the sky.

In Ald'ruhn's shell where Redorans dwell,
The gossip flows like a magic spell.
Of Temple priests and dark cults hidden,
Of prophecies long forbidden.

Listen close, but speak with care,
In Morrowind, words have power rare.

    [4] = {
        title = "The Bardic Art",
        content = [[
The art of barding is ancient and deep,
More than just songs that lovers keep.
It's the weaving of words with magic and might,
The crafting of tales in the pale moonlight.

A true bard can calm a raging heart,
Or tear kingdoms apart with a single art.
Their instrument is more than wood and string,
It's a conduit for the soul's own spring.

To master this art takes years of devotion,
To learn the power of sound and emotion.

    },
    [5] = {
        title = "Wisdom in Silence",
        content = [[
Sometimes the wisest words are none,
Sometimes the best path left unrun.
The bards know this secret well,
That silence too can cast a spell.

Not every question needs an answer,
Not every door must be opened wider.
Some mysteries are best preserved,
Some stories better left unheard.

Still, the bard's door stands ever open,
For when you're ready, hoping, hoping.
