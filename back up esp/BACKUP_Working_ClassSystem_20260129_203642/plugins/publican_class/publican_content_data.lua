The whispers in Balmora's streets tell tales,
Of merchants rich and ancient trails.
The Telvanni wizards in their towers high,
Keep secrets that touch the sky.

In Ald'ruhn's shell where Redorans dwell,
The gossip flows like a magic spell.
Of Temple priests and dark cults hidden,
Of prophecies long forbidden.

Listen close, but speak with care,
In Morrowind, words have power rare.

        content = [[
The trade routes through Vvardenfell,
Bring fortunes that merchants tell.
From ebony to glass, from kwama eggs,
To exotic goods from foreign legs.

The East Empire Company's might,
Controls the trade with all their might.
But local merchants still find ways,
To profit through these troubled days.

Invest wisely, friend, I say,
For fortune turns like night to day.

Our rooms are clean, our beds are soft,
A traveler's comfort, held aloft.
For just ten coins, you can rest,
And put your weary mind to test.

The common room is warm and bright,
With fellow travelers each night.
Share stories, songs, and ale so fine,
Until the morning sun does shine.

We've rooms for all, from rich to poor,
Just ask me friend, I'll show you more.

        content = [[
The bards who play here every night,
Fill hearts with joy and pure delight.
Their songs of heroes, love, and war,
Echo through our tavern door.

Some nights we have a poet speak,
Who makes the strongest grown men weep.
Other nights, a minstrel plays,
And brightens up these dreary days.

The patrons love the lively scene,
The best entertainment you've seen.

Ah, welcome traveler, take a seat,
Rest your weary, tired feet.
I've seen many faces pass through here,
Some full of joy, some full of fear.

This tavern has stood for many years,
Through laughter, tears, and silent cheers.
It's more than just a place to drink,
It's where life's stories interlink.

So tell me friend, what brings you here?
To Vvardenfell, this land so dear?
