*The Imperial guard stands with perfect military posture*

Imperial law is the foundation of civilization.
Without law, there is only chaos.
Without order, there is only barbarism.

In Morrowind, Imperial law exists alongside Dunmer customs,
but always above them. The Emperor's justice
transcends local traditions and petty house disputes.

The law is clear: murder is illegal, theft is illegal,
assault is illegal, necromancy is illegal.
These are not suggestions - they are the pillars
that hold society together.

Some Dunmer complain that Imperial law
interferes with their "traditions."
But traditions that violate basic rights
are not traditions - they are crimes.

My duty is to enforce the Emperor's law
without favor, without prejudice, without fear.
Justice is blind to house affiliation, wealth, or status.

This is what separates civilization from savagery.
This is the gift the Empire brings to Morrowind.

*The guard's eyes show the discipline of years of training*

Service in the Imperial Legion is the highest honor
a citizen of the Empire can achieve.

We are more than soldiers - we are the embodiment
of Imperial authority, the visible presence
of the Emperor's will in every province.

Our duties are many and varied:
patrolling the roads to ensure safe travel,
guarding Imperial installations and officials,
investigating crimes and apprehending suspects,
maintaining the peace between rival factions.

But our most important duty?
To be the shield that protects the innocent
from those who would harm them.
To be the sword that strikes down those
who would threaten the peace and order
that the Empire provides.

Every day I wear this armor, every patrol I walk,
every law I enforce - I am serving something
greater than myself. I am serving the Emperor,
the Empire, and the millions of citizens
who depend on us for their safety and security.

This is the burden of Legion service.
And the greatest privilege a man can know.

        content = [[
*The guard's expression becomes professionally neutral*

The Dunmer Great Houses... each presents unique challenges
to Imperial administration and law enforcement.

House Redoran respects strength and honor,
which makes them reliable allies when their interests
align with Imperial justice. They understand duty.

House Hlaalu values profit above all else,
which makes them predictable but sometimes problematic.
Their "flexible" interpretation of law requires
careful Imperial oversight.

House Telvanni considers themselves above Imperial law,
believing their magical power places them beyond
mortal authority. They require... firm handling.

The other houses each have their quirks,
but ultimately, all must understand that Imperial law
applies equally to every citizen of Morrowind,
regardless of house affiliation or magical ability.

The Empire does not seek to destroy the Great Houses.
We seek to bring them into the civilized world,
to teach them that there is strength in unity,
that there is prosperity in peace, that there is
security in justice rather than constant conflict.

Some learn this lesson faster than others.

*The guard gestures toward the Imperial forts and settlements*

Why is the Empire in Morrowind? Some ask this question
as if our presence is an invasion or occupation.

The Empire is here because Morrowind is part of the Empire.
Because the Emperor swore an oath to protect all Imperial citizens,
whether they live in the Imperial City or on the distant island
of Vvardenfell.

We are here because the blight threatens not just Dunmer,
but all of Tamriel. Because Dagoth Ur's madness
endangers the entire world, not just one province.

We are here to bring civilization to a land
that has known too much conflict, too much suffering,
too much chaos for too long.

We are here to build roads, establish trade,
protect merchants, maintain order, and ensure that
the people of Morrowind can live their lives
without fear of blight monsters, house wars,
or lawless bandits.

Some resist our presence, fearing change.
But progress cannot be stopped, only delayed.
The Empire brings the future, whether Morrowind is ready
or not. We are the agents of that future.

*The guard's tone becomes that of a patient teacher*

What should citizens of the Empire know?

First: Know your rights and your responsibilities.
You have the right to safety, to justice, to fair treatment.
You have the responsibility to obey the law, to respect others,
to contribute to the peace and prosperity of all.

Second: Understand that Imperial law protects everyone equally.
A noble from House Redoran and a common laborer from House Hlaalu
stand equal before Imperial justice. Wealth, power, and magic
do not exempt anyone from the Emperor's law.

Third: Report crimes when you see them.
Stay silent about injustice, and you become complicit.
Help us maintain order, and we all benefit from the peace.

Finally: Remember that the Empire is not your enemy.
We are your protectors, your guardians, your guarantee
that civilization will not fall to chaos, that law will not
bow to tradition, that justice will not be silenced by power.

The Empire brings order to chaos, peace to conflict,
law to anarchy, and civilization to savagery.
These are not burdens - they are blessings.

Embrace them, and you will know true freedom.
