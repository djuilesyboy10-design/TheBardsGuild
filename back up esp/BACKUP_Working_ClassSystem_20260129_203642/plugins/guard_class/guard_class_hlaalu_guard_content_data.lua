*The Hlaalu guard adjusts their House insignia*

Security in Hlaalu territory?
It's different than Imperial justice.
We protect House interests first,
the Empire second.

Our main concerns are trade routes,
caravan protection, and customs enforcement.
Smugglers hate us, merchants respect us.
That's how you know we're doing our job.

House Hlaalu values prosperity above all.
Where there's coin, there's Hlaalu guards.
We keep the markets safe,
the roads open, the taxes flowing.

Imperial Legion handles the big threats,
we handle the daily business.
It's a system that works,
as long as everyone knows their place.

*The guard gestures toward the trading district*

Troublemakers in Hlaalu lands?
Usually it's about money.

Competition merchants trying to sabotage rivals,
smugglers avoiding House tariffs,
foreign agents undermining our trade.

Redoran calls us corrupt,
Telvanni calls us greedy.
They're just jealous of our success.
Business requires flexibility, something they don't understand.

We deal with problems quietly.
A word here, a coin there,
sometimes a blade in the dark.
Whatever protects House prosperity.

The smart ones learn the rules quickly.
House Hlaalu rewards loyalty,
and punishes interference.

*The guard points to the bustling marketplace*

My patrol? The lifeblood of Vvardenfell.

I watch the merchants,
ensure fair trading,
collect House taxes.
Every coin that passes through here
belongs partly to House Hlaalu.

We escort caravans between cities,
protect our trade investments,
sometimes "persuade" competitors
to see things our way.

Imperial guards handle the walls,
we handle the wealth.
It's a good division.
They get the glory, we get the gold.

Without Hlaalu guards,
this island would starve.
Remember that when you see us collecting taxes.

*The guard speaks with practiced respect*

House Hlaalu leadership?
Smart, practical, profitable.

Duke Vedam Dren understands reality.
The Empire is here to stay,
trade is the future,
tradition adapts or dies.

Our councilors are merchants,
warriors, diplomats.
They know how to turn a profit
while keeping the peace.

Other houses call us collaborators.
We call ourselves survivors.
Why cling to old ways
when new ways bring prosperity?

The Duke has made House Hlaalu
the most powerful house on Vvardenfell.
That's leadership worth following.

*The guard offers practical, business-minded advice*

Safety in Hlaalu territory?
Think like a merchant.

First: Know the value of everything.
Including your own life.
Don't risk what you can't afford to lose.

Second: Build relationships.
A known customer is safer than a stranger.
Network, make connections,
owe favors and collect them.

Third: Understand the system.
Taxes, permits, licenses.
They're not obstacles, they're opportunities.
The smart ones profit from them.

Finally: Remember House Hlaalu's motto.
"Prosperity favors the bold."
But also favors the prepared,
the connected, the useful.

Be useful to House Hlaalu,
and House Hlaalu will be useful to you.
