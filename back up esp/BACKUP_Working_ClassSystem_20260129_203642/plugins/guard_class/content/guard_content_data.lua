*The guard scans the area with practiced eyes*

Security here is... manageable.
Most days it's quiet, just the usual rabble.
But nights bring out the desperate ones.

We've had some trouble near the docks,
smugglers trying to move goods without Imperial tax.
A few knife fights in the alleyways,
nothing the Legion can't handle.

The real problems?
Those you don't see.
The ones who move in shadows,
who deal in things better left buried.

My advice? Stay on the main roads after dark.
Keep your coin purse close.
And don't ask questions about the noises
that sometimes come from the sewers.

This is Morrowind.
Even the quiet streets have teeth.

        title = "Troublemakers",
        content = [[
*The guard lowers their voice, glancing around*

Troublemakers... always a few types.

First you've got the drunks.
Harmless mostly, just loud and stupid.
Sleep it off in the cells, pay their fine,
back to the taverns by next evening.

Then there are the pickpockets.
Quick fingers, empty eyes.
They work the crowds near the market,
disappear like smoke when you approach.

Worst are the organized ones.
They don't work alone.
Someone coordinates them,
someone takes the real cut.

We watch them, we know their patterns.
But proving anything?
That's harder than it looks.
The smart criminals leave no witnesses.

    [3] = {
        title = "Patrol Duties",
        content = [[
*The guard shifts their weight, armor clinking softly*

Patrol... it's routine mostly.
Same streets, same faces, same threats.

Day shift: Market watch, gate duty,
breaking up the occasional brawl.
Keep the merchants happy, keep the peace.
Simple enough.

Night shift: That's when it gets interesting.
Shadows play tricks on your eyes.
Every sound could be trouble.
Every dark corner could hide a blade.

We walk the walls, check the gates,
make sure the dead stay dead.
This close to Ghostgate,
you learn to be careful about what's buried.

Long hours, little thanks.
But someone has to do it.
Better us than them, right?

    [4] = {
        title = "Local Leadership",
        content = [[
*The guard's expression becomes carefully neutral*

The local leadership...
well, they pay our wages, don't they?

The council members talk big,
make promises they can't keep.
But they keep the coin flowing,
so the Legion stays content.

The Great Houses play their games,
each trying to outmaneuver the others.
We just stay out of it.
Politics is above our pay grade.

Imperial officials?
They come and go.
New faces every few years,
same old demands, same old complaints.

As long as they leave us alone
to do our actual jobs,
I've no complaints about leadership.

    [5] = {
        title = "Safety Advice",
        content = [[
*The guard gestures with practiced authority*

Safety advice? Listen close.

First: Know your surroundings.
Don't wander into strange districts
without knowing who controls them.
Some neighborhoods don't like strangers.

Second: Travel light, but armed.
A dagger won't stop a determined attacker,
but it might make them think twice.
Appearances matter in Morrowind.

Third: Watch who you talk to.
Not everyone who smiles is friendly.
Information is currency here,
and some people pay with blood.

Finally: Learn the local customs.
What's polite in one district
is an insult in another.
Respect keeps you alive longer.

Follow these rules,
and you might just survive Vvardenfell.
