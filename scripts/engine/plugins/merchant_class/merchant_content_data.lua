*The merchant glances around, then leans forward*

Ah, traveler! The talk in Balmora is all about strange lights,
lights seen over Ghostgate in the dead of night.
The Temple's calling it an omen, a sign from the gods,
but the old folk... they remember the last time such lights appeared.

And speaking of strange things,
a caravan from the west arrived without half its merchants.
They claim bandits, they claim simple thieves,
but I saw fear in their eyes that no simple thief could cause.

But the most interesting tale?
They say someone has been asking questions,
questions about the old bardic colleges.
The ones that haven't been used since the War of the First Council...

*The merchant leans in, voice dropping to a whisper*

This very shop... it stands on ground that's seen more than most realize.
The Dwemer left tunnels beneath this city,
and sometimes... sometimes I hear things when it's quiet.

They say that beneath the Lucky Lockup,
there's a chamber that hasn't been opened in centuries.
Not that I'd go looking, mind you.
Some doors are best left closed.

But if you're the curious type,
pay attention to the stonework around the council club.
The patterns don't quite match...

*The merchant's eyes light up with memory*

Oh, that would be the Telvanni wizard who came in last month.
Bought every empty soul gem I had,
paid in pure gold, and never once haggled on price.

But what was strange...
he asked if I'd seen any "singing stones."
Said they were ancient artifacts that responded to music.
Never heard of such things, but the way he spoke...

He left me with this strange coin -
it feels warm to the touch, even on cold days.
Sometimes I think I can hear it humming,
when no one's around.

*The merchant strokes their chin thoughtfully*

Most folks think it's ebony or glass,
but they're wrong.
The real wealth here is knowledge.

The Dunmer have forgotten more than most races ever knew.
Those ancient ruins?
They're not just full of treasure -
they're full of answers.
Answers to questions people haven't even thought to ask yet.

But be careful, traveler.
Some knowledge is heavy.
Once you learn certain things, you can't unlearn them.
The old saying is true:
some doors, once opened, can never be fully closed again.

*The merchant's expression grows serious*

Listen carefully, friend.
In Morrowind, everything has a price,
but not all prices are paid in gold.

Trust your instincts, but question your assumptions.
The most dangerous things here often wear the friendliest faces.
And the most valuable allies might not look like much at first.

Most importantly: learn to listen.
Not just to people, but to the land itself.
This island... it speaks to those who know how to hear.
The ash storms, the red mountain, even the silence -
they all have stories to tell.

Stay safe, but stay curious.
That's the real treasure here.
