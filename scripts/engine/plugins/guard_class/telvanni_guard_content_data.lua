*The Telvanni guard's eyes glow with faint magical energy*

Secrets? Mortals think secrets are hidden things,
whispered in shadows, written in coded texts.

Telvanni knows better.
The greatest secrets are hidden in plain sight,
disguised as common knowledge, dismissed as myth.

We guard the secrets that would shatter lesser minds.
The nature of the gods, the fabric of reality,
the true purpose of the blight, the paths between worlds.

But our most important secret?
That power is not about strength or numbers.
True power comes from knowledge, from understanding,
from seeing the patterns that others miss.

Every spell we cast, every enchantment we weave,
reveals another layer of reality's illusion.
Most mortals cannot handle such truth.

Telvanni guards these secrets not from greed,
but from wisdom. Some knowledge is a burden
too heavy for ordinary shoulders to bear.

*The guard gestures toward the floating towers in the distance*

Our towers? They are not merely buildings.
They are statements of power, manifestos of magic.

Each tower is a conduit, a focal point,
where the veil between worlds grows thin.
Where mortal will can bend reality to its purpose.

Sadrith Mora, Tel Vos, Tel Aruhn...
each serves a different magical purpose.
Some focus on destruction, others on creation,
some on knowledge, others on power.

The towers float because we willed them to float.
They defy gravity because we mastered the forces
that bind lesser beings to the earth.

Other houses build with stone and mortar.
Telvanni builds with will and knowledge.
Our towers are not structures - they are spells
made permanent, given form and function.

To enter a Telvanni tower is to step
between the folds of reality itself.

*The guard's voice takes on a hypnotic, melodic quality*

Other houses see magic as a tool.
A weapon, a convenience, a means to an end.

Telvanni understands: Magic is not a tool.
Magic is the fundamental language of existence.
Every atom, every thought, every dream
is an expression of magical reality.

To truly master magic is to master reality itself.
This is why other houses fear us.
Not because we are more powerful,
but because we understand what power truly means.

They see spells and enchantments.
We see the underlying patterns of creation.
They learn to manipulate forces.
We learn to rewrite the rules.

Magic is not something you do.
Magic is something you ARE.
This is the Telvanni way.
This is the truth that sets us free.

        title = "Telvanni Politics",
        content = [[
*The guard smiles with ancient wisdom in their eyes*

Politics? The games lesser houses play?

House Redoran obsesses over honor and duty,
yet their honor serves only their pride.
House Hlaalu chases after gold and influence,
yet their wealth cannot buy true power.
House Dagoth... that is a cautionary tale,
of what happens when power corrupts completely.

Telvanni plays no such games.
Why compete for scraps of mortal authority
when you can reshape reality itself?

Our council meetings are not debates.
They are symphonies of will, where minds
more powerful than armies shape the future
of entire worlds without raising a single sword.

Other houses think we are aloof, mysterious.
They are right. We operate on levels
their minds cannot comprehend, following patterns
their eyes cannot perceive.

Let them have their politics.
Telvanni has reality itself to command.

*The guard leans forward, voice dropping to a whisper*

You seek wisdom from a Telvanni guard?
Then understand this first:

Power is not the ability to destroy.
True power is the ability to create,
to transform, to transcend the limitations
that bind lesser minds to mortal concerns.

Knowledge is not the accumulation of facts.
True knowledge is the recognition of patterns,
the understanding that all things are connected,
that the smallest spell can reshape the universe.

Magic is not the manipulation of energy.
True magic is the alignment of will with reality,
the recognition that the distinction between
caster and spell, between mind and matter,
is an illusion maintained by the ignorant.

The greatest secret Telvanni guards?
That you, like all mortals, possess the potential
for infinite power, infinite knowledge, infinite being.

But potential without understanding is merely chaos.
Wisdom without power is merely philosophy.
Only when will and knowledge unite
does true magic emerge.

Now you understand why we guard our secrets.
Not to keep them from you, but to keep you
from destroying yourself with truths
you are not yet ready to comprehend.
