*The guard scans the area with practiced eyes*

Security in Balmora is... manageable.
Most days it's quiet, just the usual river traffic.
But nights bring out the desperate ones.

We've had some trouble near the silt strider port,
smugglers trying to move goods without Hlaalu tax.
A few knife fights in the alleyways behind the council halls,
nothing the Hlaalu guards can't handle.

The real problems?
Those come from the West Gash.
Smugglers using the foyadas to move contraband,
thinking we won't follow them into the ash lands.

My advice? Stay on the Odai River roads after dark.
Keep your coin purse close in the market district.
And don't ask questions about the cargo
that sometimes moves through the canal tunnels.

This is Hlaalu territory.
Even the peaceful trade routes have hidden dangers.

*The guard lowers their voice, glancing around*

Troublemakers... always a few types in Balmora.

First you've got the drunks.
Mostly from the tavern district near the river,
Harmless enough, just loud and stupid.
Sleep it off in our cells, pay their fine to the Hlaalu treasury,
back to the Eight Plates by next evening.

Then there are the pickpockets.
Quick fingers, empty eyes.
They work the crowds near the silt strider port,
target merchants fresh from Vivec.
Disappear like smoke through the canal tunnels when we approach.

Worst are the Hlaalu business rivals.
They don't use knives, they use ledgers.
Someone coordinates price fixing,
someone takes the real cut from honest merchants.

We watch them, we know their patterns.
But proving anything?
That's harder than it looks when they own half the council.
The smart criminals wear expensive clothes and sit on committees.

*The guard shifts their weight, armor clinking softly*

Patrol... it's routine mostly.
Same streets, same faces, same threats.

Day shift: Market watch, silt strider port duty,
breaking up the occasional brawl near the taverns.
Keep the Hlaalu merchants happy, keep the trade flowing.
Simple enough.

Night shift: That's when it gets interesting.
Shadows play tricks on your eyes along the Odai River.
Every sound could be trouble.
Every dark corner could hide a smuggler.

We walk the Balmora walls, check the city gates,
make sure the canal tunnels stay secure.
This close to the West Gash,
you learn to be careful about what crosses the foyadas.

Long hours, little thanks from the council members.
But someone has to protect Hlaalu interests.
Better us than the Redoran patrols, right?
At least we understand business.

        title = "Local Leadership",
        content = [[
*The guard's expression becomes carefully neutral*

The local leadership...
well, they pay our wages, don't they?

The Hlaalu council members talk big,
make trade deals they can't always keep.
But they keep the coin flowing through Balmora,
so the Imperial Legion stays content.

The merchant families play their games,
each trying to outmaneuver the others at the port.
We just stay out of their business disputes.
Politics is above our pay grade, especially Hlaalu politics.

Imperial officials?
They come and go from the fort.
Different faces now and then,
same old tax demands, same old complaints about smuggling.

As long as the council leaves us alone
to actually guard the city,
I've no complaints about Hlaalu leadership.
At least they understand that security is good for business.

        title = "Safety Advice",
        content = [[
*The guard gestures with practiced authority*

Safety advice? Listen close.

First: Know your surroundings in Balmora.
Don't wander into the canal tunnels
without knowing who controls them.
The smugglers don't like strangers near their routes.

Second: Travel light, but prepared.
A healing potion won't stop a determined attacker,
but it might save your life after the fight.
Always carry a potion of Almsivi Intervention
- gets you out of trouble fast.

Third: Watch who you talk to at the silt strider port.
Not everyone who smiles is friendly.
Information is currency in Hlaalu territory,
and some people pay with blood.

Finally: Learn the local customs.
What's polite in the market district
is an insult near the council halls.
Respect for Hlaalu merchants keeps you alive longer.

And always carry stamina potions.
The West Gash roads are long,
and you never know when you'll need to run fast.
