more merchants than I've seen in months.

The Hlaalu are cracking down on bandits lately,
but this is great for business,
keeps coin flowing my way.

But West Gash still has problems,
smugglers near the foyadas,
best keep your distance there.

Weather's been fair enough for travel,
but the Ashlands?
Its always unpredictable, you know how it is.

The journey North needs good protection,
the ash storms don't care about your plans.

That's the road news from here,
safe travels, friend.]]

        title = "Trade Routes",
        content = [[I know these roads like the back of my hand,
Balmora to Vivec is the safest bet,
well-traveled, patrolled regularly.

North to Ald'ruhn?
Caldera route is faster but more dangerous,
terrain's rough, fewer settlements,
not for the faint of heart.

For the truly adventurous,
Sadrith Mora route is profitable but risky,
weather and unsavory characters both,
need to watch your back there.

My advice?
Stick to the main roads,
unless you have a good reason
to venture off the beaten path.

That's the route wisdom from here,
may your travels be safe.]]

        title = "Road Dangers",
        content = [[You're wise to ask about dangers,
bandits are the most common threat,
especially in the less-traveled areas, you know?

They usually operate in small groups,
and they'll avoid a fight if you're well-armed,
cowards really, when it comes down to it.

The Ashlands have their own hazards,
ash storms can appear without warning,
and creatures like nix-hounds and alit
are always a concern out there.

Don't even get me started
on what lurks in Red Mountain region,
some things are best left alone, trust me.

Then there are the smugglers,
now they're not necessarily hostile,
but you don't want to get caught up
in their business, I can tell you that.

Imperial guards don't take kindly
to smugglers or their associates,
so best keep your distance from them.

My best advice?
Travel during daylight hours,
and stay on the main roads,
always keep an eye on your surroundings.

That's the danger wisdom from here,
stay alert, stay alive, friend.]]

        title = "Caravan Cargo",
        content = [[Ah, what we carry!
It depends on the route and season, you know.

On the Balmora-Vivec route,
we mostly transport trade goods,
cloth, spices, tools,
and sometimes luxury items
for the wealthy residents of Vivec.

The northern routes are different,
we carry mining equipment to Caldera,
weapons and armor to Ald'ruhn,
and sometimes rare ingredients
for the Telvanni wizards in the east.

Some caravans specialize,
I know one that only transports
alcoholic beverages, you know,
another deals in precious metals,
and a few that handle... well,
let's just say 'unregulated' goods.

The most valuable cargo?
Usually information, trust me.

Merchants pay well for timely news,
market conditions, political developments,
and of course, road conditions.

That's why caravaners like me
always have the latest gossip!

That's the cargo wisdom from here,
may your trades be prosperous.]]

just the usual caravan business, you know?

Trade's been steady,
roads are quiet enough,
weather's been fair.

Nothing special to report,
just the same old roads,
same old destinations.

That's the road wisdom from here,
safe travels, friend.]]
