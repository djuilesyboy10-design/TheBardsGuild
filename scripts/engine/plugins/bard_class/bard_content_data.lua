The ancient art of Bard Lore speaks of heroes long past,
you know, their songs and stories echo through time.

Each verse is really a treasure,
each melody like a key,
to unlock the mysteries of history's grand design.

From tavern halls to castle courts so grand,
bards weave these tales across the land.

Their words carry real power,
their music brings peace to troubled hearts,
a legacy that will never cease, you see?

        content = [[
In Morrowind's land where ash falls gray,
you know, the bards sing songs of olden days.

They tell of heroes brave and dragons old,
of stories worth more than gold, really.

From Red Mountain all the way to the sea,
their melodies float wild and free, you see?

Each note is a memory, each chord a tale,
where magic and reality seem to prevail.

It's amazing how these old songs still resonate,
even after all these years, don't you think?

        title = "Whispers and Rumors",
        content = [[
The whispers in Balmora's streets tell tales,
Of merchants rich and ancient trails.
The Telvanni wizards in their towers high,
Keep secrets that touch the sky.

In Ald'ruhn's shell where Redorans dwell,
The gossip flows like a magic spell.
Of Temple priests and dark cults hidden,
Of prophecies long forbidden.

Listen close, but speak with care,
In Morrowind, words have power rare.

        title = "The Bardic Art",
        content = [[
The art of barding is ancient and deep,
More than just songs that lovers keep.
It's the weaving of words with magic and might,
The crafting of tales in the pale moonlight.

A true bard can calm a raging heart,
Or tear kingdoms apart with a single art.
Their instrument is more than wood and string,
It's a conduit for the soul's own spring.

To master this art takes years of devotion,
To learn the power of sound and emotion.

    [5] = {
        title = "Wisdom in Silence",
        content = [[
Sometimes the wisest words are none,
Sometimes the best path left unturned.
The bards know this secret well,
That silence too can cast a spell.

Not every question needs an answer,
Not every door must be opened wider.
Some mysteries are best preserved,
Some stories better left unheard.

Still, the bard's door stands ever open,
For when you're ready, hoping, hoping.
