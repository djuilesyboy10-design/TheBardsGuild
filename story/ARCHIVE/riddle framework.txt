1. The Three Ways Words Harm

(Pure speech puzzle, no objects)

Core idea:
The player is told a story or accusation. They must respond in one of three ways of speaking, not three opinions.

The riddle is not what is true, but how to say something.

Framework:

NPC asks: “If a lie saves a village but ruins a name, what do you call it?”

Player must answer in:

Containment → softening, deflection, silence, delay

Distortion → reframing, poetic truth, half-truth

Contamination → blunt naming, exposure, weaponized truth

Puzzle angle:

The “correct” answer depends on who is listening.

Saying the same words to a different NPC later has a different outcome.

This teaches the player:

Speech is not about truth. It is about damage radius.

2. The Locked Mouth

(Riddle where silence is an option)

Core idea:
A question is posed that cannot be safely answered.

The puzzle is realizing that not answering is the answer.

Framework:

NPC says: “Tell me the name of the one who sang first.”

Dialogue options include:

Naming a myth

Naming a god

Naming a mortal

Refusing / redirecting / asking a question back

Puzzle logic:

Any direct answer causes harm (quest flags worsen).

Only indirect speech (“Names rot when spoken”) advances safely.

This aligns perfectly with your theme:

Some words should not survive being said.

3. The Borrowed Voice

(Player speaks as someone else)

Core idea:
The player must deliver a message without owning it.

Framework:

Player is given a phrase and told:

“Say this, but do not make it yours.”

Dialogue options change tone:

Quoted speech

Rumor speech (“It’s said that…”)

Song / proverb

Personal declaration

Puzzle layer:

The content stays the same.

Only ownership changes the outcome.

Failure condition:

Taking credit or speaking directly triggers backlash.

This reinforces Bard doctrine:

Ownership of words is heavier than truth.

4. The Audience Test

(Same riddle, multiple listeners)

Core idea:
The puzzle is not the answer — it’s who hears it.

Framework:

Player must answer a riddle three times:

To a child

To an elder

To an official

Each time:

Same question

Different safe answer

Example prompt:

“Why did the song end?”

Correct logic:

Child → comfort

Elder → memory

Official → record / control

Failing means social consequences, not combat.

5. The Word That Moves

(Spatial speech puzzle)

Core idea:
Where you stand determines what words mean.

Framework:

NPC tells player:

“Speak the answer, but not here.”

Player must:

Step closer

Step away

Turn their back

Leave the room and return

Dialogue options remain identical, but outcomes change.

This mirrors your spatial sound ideas:

Words come from places, not mouths.

6. The False Choice

(All answers are wrong — except why)

Core idea:
The NPC presents three answers — all flawed.

The puzzle is:

Calling out the structure of the question.

Framework:

NPC: “Which of these is the true song?”

“The one remembered”

“The one recorded”

“The one sung last”

Hidden correct response:

“Songs don’t survive by being true.”

This advances the quest only if the player refuses the premise.

7. The Stolen Ending

(Player must finish a story incorrectly)

Core idea:
The NPC tells a well-known myth — but stops before the end.

Framework:

Player is expected to:

Finish it “wrong”

Or change the ending to prevent harm

Puzzle:

Correct choice is the one that prevents the story from functioning as propaganda.

This ties directly into:

Mora’s desire for closed records

Your archive-vs-chorus theme

8. The Echo Test

(Delayed consequence speech puzzle)

Core idea:
The riddle resolves later, not immediately.

Framework:

Player answers a riddle.

NPC reacts neutrally.

Hours or quests later:

Someone repeats the player’s words back at them

Slightly changed

The puzzle:

Did the words survive distortion?

Success is measured by:

How little damage the echo does.

How this fits your system perfectly

All of these:

Work with journal-only morality

Require no scripting

Scale across races and institutions

Reinforce Bard ≠ Mage ≠ Priest

And most importantly:

They teach the player how your world thinks
before they ever see the mechanics.

Next step when you’re ready:

Pick one framework

Decide who controls the question

Decide who pays the price

Say the word and we’ll crystallize one into an actual in-game riddle with dialogue branches
