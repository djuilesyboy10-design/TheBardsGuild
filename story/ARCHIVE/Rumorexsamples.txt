CORE TOPIC

Topic: Lost Song
(Never renamed. Only conditioned, gated, or reframed.)

This topic always exists once the quest is complete.
What changes is who is allowed to know which layer.

KNOWLEDGE TIERS (what the world “knows”)
Tier 0 — Ignorance / Background Noise

NPCs: Commoners, guards, most traders
State: Hearsay only

“I heard the Guild found something old.”

“They say there’s a song the Temple doesn’t like.”

“Probably just another bard’s trick.”

👉 No facts. No names. No danger.

Tier 1 — Cultural Recognition

NPCs: Khajiit traders, scholars, Ashlanders (non-initiates)
State: Pattern recognition, not proof

Derived from:

“very old… speaks of the Hortator and the Three… called Apographa”

“Some writings are older than the Temple admits.”

“When a song mentions Nerevar, the Ordinators sharpen blades.”

“Apographa brings trouble, even when true.”

👉 Truth-adjacent, but cautious.

Tier 2 — Ritual Knowledge

NPCs: Ashlanders, Wise Women, mystics
State: Spiritual framing

Derived from:

“We do not give our breath to those who cannot be still.”

“Songs are not sung. They are waited for.”

“If the spirits answered you, you were meant to hear it.”

“Fragments are safer than verses.”

👉 The song is real, but incomplete by design.

Tier 3 — Scholarly Confirmation

NPCs: Jobasha, Shane gra-Bagol, select mages
State: Verified authenticity, high risk

Derived from:

“unmistakable archaic Chimeri Apographa… authentic… dangerous”

“The meter alone condemns it.”

“The Temple fears structure more than lies.”

“Completion would require priests the Temple watches closely.”

👉 This is the highest explicit truth the world admits.

Tier 4 — Suppressed Truth (Player + Inner Guild)

NPCs: Bard leadership, Dissident-aligned NPCs
State: Strategic silence

Derived from:

“The Temple’s eyes are everywhere… We must be patient.”

“The song can pacify the sleeper — or shatter the soul.”

“Finishing it too early would destroy the Guild.”

“The chorus must grow before the final verse.”

👉 This tier never leaks into rumors directly.

MORAL PATH ECHOES (how NPCs interpret it)

These do not change the topic, only the tone.

Containment (Good)

“Some truths must be carried quietly.”

“A song can heal if sung at the right time.”

Distortion (Myth)

“Maybe the song never existed whole.”

“Maybe the danger is the point.”

Contamination (Bad)

“Why hide it? Let the Temple choke on it.”

“If it breaks the world, it deserved breaking.”

FAILURE & SKILL GATING (engine-native)

Using your system:

Speechcraft / Sneak / Personality

Success → NPC advances one knowledge tier

Failure → NPC deflects into rumor or fear

Rumors as failure buffer

Failed truth attempt does not hard-fail

Instead seeds false but plausible versions

Example:

“I heard the song puts sleepers to rest forever.”
(Danger inflated, truth distorted)

WHY THIS WORKS (design lock)

✔ One topic (Lost Song)

✔ Many reactions

✔ No globals required

✔ Native CS-friendly

✔ Lua-enhanceable but not Lua-dependent

✔ Scales to late-game reveal without retcon

This is exactly how Morrowind itself handles the Nerevarine —
you’ve just formalized it into a reusable system.
