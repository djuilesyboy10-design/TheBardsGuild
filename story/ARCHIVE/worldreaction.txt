World Memory & Reaction Framework (universal)
World Memory & Reaction Framework

A universal reference for handling how the world remembers a known truth after a quest is completed.

1. Fixed Truth (Player-Known Core)

Event: The quest outcome that objectively occurred (e.g., discovery of the Lost Song / Lament fragment).

Evidence: Artifacts, transcripts, rites witnessed, or oral fragments (e.g., Apographa parchment, Ash-Singer rites).

Danger Level: Why the truth is volatile (heresy, political threat, spiritual risk).

Custodians: Who understands the danger best (Guild, Ashlanders, Scholars, Dissidents).

This layer never changes. It is what actually happened.

2. Memory Filters (How Truth Becomes Story)

Each NPC remembers the event through one dominant filter:

Faction Lens

Temple: Heresy, Apographa, censorship, danger.

Guild: Archive, protection, chorus, responsibility.

Dissidents: Suppressed truth, fragments, urgency.

Trade / Profession Lens

Scholars: Authenticity, meter, provenance, risk of exposure.

Traders: Value, danger of possession, rumors of price or bounty.

Performers: Song vs silence, incomplete verses, forbidden music.

Cultural Lens

Ashlanders: Rites, waiting, breath, ancestors, mountain memory.

Imperials: Curiosity, academic detachment, political risk.

Personal Temperament

Cautious: “This should not be spoken aloud.”

Proud: “We guarded this when others burned it.”

Fearful: “Ordinators are listening.”

3. Knowledge Bands (Who Knows What)

NPCs fall into tiers of awareness:

Ignorant – Only hears a distorted rumor.

Informed – Knows something happened, but not details.

Aware – Recognizes names and terms (Nerevar, Apographa, Ash-Singer).

Initiated – Understands the danger and fragmentation.

Custodian – Actively protects, suppresses, or archives the truth.

Dialogue depth scales by band, not by quest stage.

4. Terminology Drift (How Words Change)

Key terms mutate depending on speaker:

Lost Song → “Old parchment” / “dangerous music” / “guild secret”

Lament of the Unmourned → “Forbidden breath” / “mountain’s tune” / “heresy”

Apographa → “Censored text” / “Temple poison” / “scholarly treasure”

No NPC repeats the same phrasing unless coordinated by faction.

5. Silence as Content

Some NPCs refuse comment.

Others speak only in warnings, riddles, or deflections.

Silence itself implies:

Surveillance

Fear

Respect

Complicity

6. Rumor Vectors

Information spreads unevenly via:

Taverns (sensationalized, incomplete)

Guild halls (measured, guarded)

Ashlander camps (ritualized, conditional)

Temples (denial, condemnation, redirection)

Each vector introduces error, emphasis, or omission.

7. Moral Imprint (Path Echo)

NPC reactions subtly reflect the player’s historical path:

Containment: Gratitude, quiet respect, guarded praise.

Distortion: Confusion, debate, conflicting accounts.

Contamination: Fear, blame, mythologizing, crackdown.

No NPC states the path outright; it is inferred.

8. Time Pressure & Heat

Early reactions: alarm, secrecy, urgency.

Mid reactions: normalization, recruitment, suppression.

Late reactions: legend, denial, institutional memory.

9. Chorus Principle

No single NPC tells the whole story.

Truth emerges only by collecting voices.

Contradictions are intentional and canonical.

10. Design Rule (Lock)

The world does not remember what happened. It remembers what it was allowed, afraid, or ready to say.

Use this framework for any completed quest where the player holds a dangerous truth.
