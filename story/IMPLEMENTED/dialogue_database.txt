Daynasa Telandas is dead. The assassination was a success, destabilizing House Hlaalu's local power. The Bards Guild has proven its worth to the silent partners in the sewers. I should report back to Jack.

The Council Club is silent. Larrius Varro's 'little story' is finished, and the Bards Guild acted as a neutral proxy for Legion justice. I should report back to Jack.

Marius gave me a specific target: Daynasa Telandas, a Hlaalu farmer in the fields south of Balmora. I need to eliminate her. Doing this will hurt House Hlaalu's reputation. I must find a way to perform this 'lullaby' silently."

I spoke with Larrius Varro. He told me a "little story" about five bad people at the Council Club who need to be removed. I am to go there and settle the matter.

Bacola Closcius knows I delivered the Khajiit to the Tong. She's sent me to the sewers in St. Olms Underworks, to meet Durus Marius. He has a "lullaby" in mind for the Council Club that requires a bard with no conscience.

Lirielle was pleased with the news from Vivec. The Bards Guild’s influence continues to grow, one story at a time. My work in Ald'ruhn for the tavern network is complete for now.

@ 4 "JMCG_Aldruhn_Seed" 13793301123248217407
The seed has been planted. Whether it was a song of goodwill, a ledger of leverage, or a new legend for the archives, the parchment is now in the hands of the people of Vivec. I should return to Lirielle in Ald'ruhn to let her know the work is done.

@ 4 "JMCG_Aldruhn_Seed" 2684010815665711560
Lirielle sees a chance to turn a dark debt into a tale of redemption. She wants me to plant a journal in the Temple Library that paints a picture of honor amidst the ash. It is a delicate game; we are replacing a harsh reality with a story that serves the higher purpose of the Guild’s moral standing

@ 4 "JMCG_Aldruhn_Seed" 18952340432690425
Lirielle wants to reshape a common tragedy into a legend. She gave me a draft of "Ruran’s Lament," a dramatized account of a rogue’s death. I am to place this in the Temple Library in Vivec. By elevating this story to a myth, we ensure the Guild not the law decides how the past is remembered.

@ 4 "JMCG_Aldruhn_Seed" 180432890642633394
Lirielle has a more subversive goal. She gave me a parchment that supposedly links the local authorities to "unfortunate necessities" involving the Council Club. I am to plant this in the No Name Club in Vivec. If the right people find it, the Guild will have a powerful leash over certain shady elements in the city.

Lirielle wishes to bridge the gap between the outlanders of Ald'ruhn and the city of Vivec. I have been given a collection of outlander verses.

She believes the only people who still know the second half of the song are the Dissident Priests hidden at Holamayan.

@ 4 "JMCG_Dragon" 4350248382891227939
I have seen fear, cycles, and melody. Each alone is a fragment. Together they feel like the edges of something greater  a name that waits to be remembered, a truth that waits to be seen. The riddle is no longer just words; it is a journey.

Yfga hums a song I cannot quite place. It seems trivial, a lullaby forgotten by most. Yet something about its rhythm mirrors what I’ve heard before — perhaps memory survives in small, sideways ways.

@ 4 "JMCG_Dragon" 804694072358629778
The Orc speaks not of fear, but of cycles and outcomes. His ledger is full of interrupted events — names erased, endings that never came. Perhaps the riddle is tied to unfinished things, to processes left open and unresolved.

If we can elevate a story from a thief's death to a Mortal tragedy of circumstance, perhaps the 'debt' Vvardenfell owes his name will finally be paid in full.

@ 0 "Bards stewartship" 15114604578617525 "lirielle stoine"
My brother Ruran wasn't just a rogue; he was a collector of unfortunate necessities. Before he died in Mallapi, he kept a ledger that would turn the Council Club into a funeral pyre. I don't want the gold backI want the story changed. Take this old parchment to the No Name Club in the Vivec Foreign Quarter.talk to Traldrisa Tervayn, see will recive you, then we Let the city believe whatever lies we sing

The dust in Ald'ruhn doesn't just settle on the streets; it settles in the lungs and the pockets of those who know how to breathe it. This one sees you have been busy with the invitation from the shadows. Jo'Zhaf does not weigh the soul, but he notes that the Rat in the Pot has many dark corners for those who prefer to keep their duties out of the light.

@ 0 "Bards stewartship" 24009110022129818199 "JMCG-Joseph"
"In Ald'ruhn, the 'kin' we must look for are those the Great Houses overlook. The outlanders and the Ashlanders who come to trade. If the Bards Guild can provide them a safe corner in the tavern, we gain ears that hear secrets the Council never touches. It is an unfortunate necessity  to deal with the Thieves Guild there, but Bacola says they are... manageable."

The network grows like a well-fed senche, walker! We have the coast, but the dusty streets of Ald'ruhn are calling.

Here is the five thousand, as promised. This transaction never happened, and these 'recipes' stay between us and the buyers shadow. Youve done well, steward.

They want those 'marsh-recipes' kept off the streets and in their private collection quietly, never to be known. The risk is high, but the weight of the gold matches it. Bring that parchment to me, and five thousand septims will move from their hand to mine, and then to yours. No questions, no records, and certainly no witnes

Most would call it a cookbook, but the 'spices' it describes? They aren't found in a garden,Its a text for those with a very specific, very ancient palate. It deals with... marsh-born flavors.

This one knows why Daisy paces the halls, yes! The Bards Guild is not just for singing pretty songs it is for speaking loud when others whisper! If she seeks to pluck her kin from the Suran markets, this one says: let us sharpen our claws together!

Help her? Iâ€™d sing a ballad for her cause if it didn't mean getting my lute smashed by an Angry Dunmer. Daisyâ€™s a socialite, sure, but sheâ€™s got a fire for her hatchlings that I haven't seen in years. Just don't tell the Guild Master I'm getting sentimental.

Do this, and you truly serve the Lamps.

To your people, an oath is a whisper on the wind, broken when the gold runs dry or the fear takes root. To the Kyn, an ironclad oath is the only thing that separates us from the mindless beast-daedra. We do not serve out of love, mortal. We serve because the hierarchy is glory. By binding ourselves to a stronger will, we find our own place in the eternal order. To break such an oath is not just a crime it is to become hornless, a soul without shape or station

You weighed the risk and brought the prize. Careful that parchment smells of the grave and the swamp. Most would scream if they saw these 'ingredients,' but we know the value of a silent trade. Here is the five thousand, as promised. This transaction never happened, and these 'recipes' stay between us and the buyer's shadow. You've done well, steward.

The Dunmer use magic to make things grow; we use resonance. If you just drop a seed in this ash, the mountain will choke it. But if you beat the ground, you wake the minerals. We call it 'Tilling the Beat.' Every strike thaws the frost and vibrates the nutrients to the surface. It is the lowest form of Stone-Singing, but without the Soil-Beaterâ€™s rhythm, the tribe would be eating nothing but salt and dust. A full belly starts with a steady strike.

I can ensure this ledger 'falls' into the right hands during my next set, but I need to know you're committed to the Guild's... sharper edges.

I am a scholar by choice, yes. I have memorized the Lay of Pall and the Tale of Lyrisius. But when I look in a mirror, I do not see a poet. I see the 'unfortunate necessity' that kept my family alive in the dunes. To survive the Alik'r, my ancestors had to be more than men they had to be monsters. That savagery is baked into my marrow.

A Breton woman, sharp-tongued and even sharper with her frost spells. She didn't care for my performance one bit. She hurried off toward Dulene Laneâ€™s place just west of here. If you find her, tell her Hisin hasn't forgotten the 'chill' she gave him!

I see everything's been taken care of. And, remarkably enough, without creating any problems of a legal nature. You are far more discrete than I had hoped. I'm so glad I found that nice present from the Emperor. Here. It seems to be a ring. A very nice ring. There was no note with it, I'm afraid. But I'll let the Emperor know you've received it. I'm sure he'll be pleased. And, also, from me, because of your exceptional discretion, take this special volume from my own library, with my compliments.

I see everything's been taken care of. And, just in case you had any problems of a legal nature, I spoke to some of my friends, and I've taken care of some things as well. And I DID find that nice present from the Emperor. Here. It seems to be a ring. A very nice ring. There was no note with it, I'm afraid. But I'll let the Emperor know you've received it. I'm sure he'll be pleased.

When you have finished doing some things, stop back and see me, and we'll see if I've found that nice present from the Emperor for you.

A keeper of records who understood omission better than ink. That is uncommon wisdom.

The Iron Records are a burden, scribe. They speak of the 950 siege and the long walk through the Alik'r. But the story you seek the 'How Orsinium Passed' is a spiritual weight. It was bound into a sacred text that was supposedly forged into steel. For that, you must speak with Lurog gro-Khagdum at the pyre.

Ziz Kurah? That is the 'Whispering Claw,' friend! It is the fastest of the four hidden dances. My father, Do-Krin Droâ€™Sakar, was a master. He said the Rawlith Khaj is like rain, and Goutfang is like a flickering flame, but the Whispering Claw? It is the wind! It is silent, lethal, and very, very quick. He taught this one that to move is to breathe. With these pants, you will dance just like him, yes?
