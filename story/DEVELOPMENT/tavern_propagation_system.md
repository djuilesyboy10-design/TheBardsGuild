Rabinna? The Khajiit slave from Hla Oad? I heard she made it to Ebonheart. The Twin Lamps are singing about a 'North-Star Lullaby' now. Dangerous song to hum in the wrong company.

That Khajiit girl slipped her chains, they say. But the Camonna Tong don't forgive interference. Someone's going to bleed for that kindness.

Rabinna? Heard the Tong moved her inland. Haven't seen her since. Some chains don't break they just change hands.

A slave escaped near Hla Oad with Bard's Guild help. Honorable, if foolish. The Camonna Tong remember such slights. I hope the rescuer's blade is as sharp as their conscience.

@ 0 "latest rumors" 582693471582693471
Rabinna the Khajiit? I heard a bard handed her to the Tong without hesitation. Cold, but practical. In war, sentiment is a luxury we cannot afford.

@ 0 "latest rumors" 693471582693471582
The Tong and the Twin Lamps are at each other's throats over some Khajiit. The Bards Guild played both sides. Clever, but dangerous. Redoran do not respect divided loyalty.

The docks are quiet now. Too quiet. After Rabinna disappeared, the Tong sent people asking questions. No one's talking. No one wants to be next.

Rabinna the Khajiit? Interesting case study in asset relocation. The Telvanni don't concern themselves with Tong politics, but the data suggests someone profited handsomely.

@ 0 "latest rumors" 037148926037148926
I heard the Bard's Guild freed a slave near Hla Oad. Sentimental, but statistically unlikely to change Vvardenfell's labor economy. Curious nonetheless.

@ 0 "latest rumors" 148926037148926037
Slave escapes rarely succeed long-term. Rabinna's case is anomalous. Either she had exceptional help, or she's already recaptured. The Telvanni will observe the outcome with interest.

# Island-wide public event - Matriarch slain, cliff racers eradicated
#==============================================================================

# BALMORA - Political crossroads, skepticism vs celebration

@ 0 "latest rumors" 259360471259360471
Saint Jiub? The cliff racers are gone, I'll give him that. But a saint? The Temple moves fast when it profits them. Convenient timing, wouldn't you say?

@ 0 "latest rumors" 360471259360471259
Have you seen the sky? Clear as glass! Jiub the Eradicator earned that sainthood. The Bards sing of him at the Eight Plates every night now. Brings in good coin.

@ 0 "latest rumors" 471259360471259360
Jiub's sainthood is pure politics. The Temple needed a hero, so they canonized a convenient one. The cliff racers dying is real. The saint part? Theater.

# ALD'RUHN - Honor-bound, respects deeds over titles

@ 0 "latest rumors" 582693704582693704
Jiub slew the Matriarch atop Red Mountain. That is a warrior's deed, worthy of song. Saint or not, he earned Redoran respect.

@ 0 "latest rumors" 693704582693704582
The Temple named him saint too quickly. Saints are forged through centuries of proof, not battlefield glory. But his deeds speak louder than titles.

@ 0 "latest rumors" 704582693704582693
The skies are clear. That is fact. Whether Jiub is a saint or simply a very dedicated hunter matters less than the result. Redoran honor deeds, not dogma.

# VIVEC - Cosmopolitan, echoes across empires

@ 0 "latest rumors" 815926037815926037
Saint Jiub! The story's already spread to Cyrodiil. Imperial scholars are debating whether the Temple has canonization authority. The bards are singing it anyway.

@ 0 "latest rumors" 926037815926037815
Jiub cleared the skies! Every tavern in the Foreign Quarter is serving 'Eradicator's Ale' now. Marketing genius, really. Saint or not, he's profitable.

@ 0 "latest rumors" 037815926037815926
The Telvanni say Jiub's story grew faster than the man. The Temple saw the legend and claimed it before it could escape their control. Brilliant political theater.

# SURAN - City of chains, cynical survivors

Saint Jiub? Good for him. The cliff racers won't bother the slave caravans anymore. That's the only miracle I care about.

@ 0 "latest rumors" 259360148259360148
Sainthood doesn't pay debts. Jiub's ballad is pretty, but it doesn't change what happens in Suran's back alleys. The world's still broken.

@ 0 "latest rumors" 360148259360148259
They say Jiub climbed Red Mountain and slew the Matriarch alone. If that's true, he's braver than any saint I've ever heard of. If it's not... well, the song's still good.

# GNAAR MOK - Edge of the map, late news, distortion

@ 0 "latest rumors" 471582693471582693
Jiub the Eradicator? Heard about that weeks late. Cliff racers are gone, sure, but we don't see many out here anyway. Seems like a mainland concern.

Saint Jiub cleared the skies? That's what the songs say. Whether it's true or just bardic fancy, I couldn't tell you. News reaches Gnaar Mok like driftwood slow and waterlogged.

@ 0 "latest rumors" 693471582693471582
I don't care if Jiub's a saint or a skooma hallucination. The cliff racers are gone. That's miracle enough for me.

@ 0 "latest rumors" 815926704815926704
The Temple says Jiub's a saint. The Bards say he's a hero. The smugglers say he's a lunatic. All I know is the sky's clearer than it's been in decades.

@ 0 "latest rumors" 926704815926704815
Sainthood's a Temple matter. Out here in Hla Oad, we judge people by what they do, not what they're called. Jiub earned his name.

# SADRITH MORA - Telvanni detachment, academic curiosity

@ 0 "latest rumors" 037148259037148259
Saint Jiub's claim is empirically verifiable: cliff racer population has declined by an estimated 94%. Sainthood is subjective. Eradication is quantifiable.

@ 0 "latest rumors" 148259037148259037
The Matriarch's death is fascinating. Single-point-of-failure ecosystem collapse. The Telvanni are already studying whether this creates an ecological void. Sainthood is irrelevant.

@ 0 "latest rumors" 259037148259037148
Jiub's ballad spread faster than any recorded Temple canonization. Memetic propagation velocity suggests cultural hunger for hero narratives post-Blight. Intriguing case study.
