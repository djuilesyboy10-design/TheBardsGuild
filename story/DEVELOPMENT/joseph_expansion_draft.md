Jo'Zhaf has marked the Eight Plates in Balmora for stewardship. The crossroads of Vvardenfell, where every faction watches and waits.

Jo'Zhaf has sent me to the Rat in the Pot in Ald'ruhn. Under Redoran eyes, words must be weighed like steel.

@ 4 "JMCG_Joseph_Lore" 471582693704815926
Jo'Zhaf has marked the Black Shalk in Vivec's Foreign Quarter. Where empires meet, every rumor echoes across three continents.

@ 4 "JMCG_Joseph_Lore" 582693704815926037
Jo'Zhaf has sent me to the Suran Tradehouse. In a city of chains, silence is both mercy and complicity.

Jo'Zhaf has marked Gnaar Mok for stewardship. Even the edge of the map must learn to listen.

Jo'Zhaf's network of taverns now spans Vvardenfell. Seven listening posts, each hearing differently. Some truths travel freely through them. Others are quietly lost.

Balmora. The beating heart of House politics. The Eight Plates tavern sits at a dangerous crossroads. Hlaalu, Redoran, outlanders, smugglers all drink there. Every word spoken is a blade waiting to be drawn. Go there. Help them understand how to listen without bleeding.

@ 0 "Bards stewartship" 037148593047582930 "JMCG-Joseph"
Ald'ruhn is not like Balmora. The Rat in the Pot serves warriors and councilors who value honor over profit. Loose tongues do not survive long under the shadow of Skar. Go there. Show them that memory can be honorable even when it is dangerous.

Vivec is the mouth of Morrowind. The Black Shalk Cornerclub serves more outlanders than Dunmer. Every rumor spoken there echoes across three empires. Go there. Help them understand that truth is a currency more valuable than drakes.

Suran is a city of chains. The Tradehouse serves slavers, pilgrims, and the desperate. Every word spoken there is soaked in blood or gold or both. Go there. Help them understand that silence can be mercy or complicity.

@ 0 "Bards stewartship" 693704815926037148 "JMCG-Joseph"
Gnaar Mok is the edge of everything. Nadene Rotheran runs a shack that pretends to be a tavern. Smugglers, fishermen, and the desperate drink there. Go there. Help her understand that even the forgotten have stories worth remembering.

Balmora listens carefully now. The Eight Plates has chosen its path. Some cities are too dangerous for truth. Others are too profitable for silence.

@ 0 "Bards stewartship" 582693704758293047 "JMCG-Joseph"
Ald'ruhn's ear is tuned now. The Redoran understand honor but honor does not always understand truth. The Rat in the Pot knows its place.

@ 0 "Bards stewartship" 704815926037482930 "JMCG-Joseph"
Vivec's ear is the most dangerous of all. Words spoken at the Black Shalk travel farther than any ship. Choose carefully what you allow to set sail.

Suran is a wound that refuses to heal. The Tradehouse has chosen its path. Some cities demand blood. Others demand silence. Suran demands both.

Gnaar Mok is the last note in a song no one remembers. Nadene has chosen her path. Even the edges of the map have ears now.

Jo'Zhaf has built something remarkable. Seven taverns, seven ways of listening. The Guild now has ears across Vvardenfell. Use them wisely.

Joseph's tavern network is a song with seven verses. Each one hears the same melody differently. Together, they compose something greater than any single voice could sing.

Jo'Zhaf's network is operational. Information flows like water now. Just remember water can drown you if you drink too deep.
